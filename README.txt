TriviaAttack is a web-based quiz game. The game randomly selects a JSON quiz from its list of available quizzes, then randomly selects questions from these quiz files, and finally presents the answers to these questions in a random order.

For this demo there is only one quiz available so the same questions will appear but in a varying order. More quizzes or questions can be written by following the JSON style of the example quiz.


--- Instructions ---

Open the game.html file on your preferred web browser (the game is browser compatible except for versions of IE before 11).

Press space to begin the game.

A question will be presented and answers will transition across the screen. Press space when there is a match to score points, incorrect answers will make the player lose points.

Try to score as many points as possible. You will receive additional points if you answer quickly.
